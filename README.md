# NaloxAware - A Non-Profit Organization

#### Link to website found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

## Current version to date:
#### Website is not yet hosted. Will be up in a week or two. Currently working on final touches, changes, and details that are requested by the organization. 

## What is it?
#### This is a front-end project that acts as the primary website for the non-profit organization NaloxAware. 
#### Founded earlier in the year 2024, NaloxAware aims to spread awareness about drugs and overdose prevention. More detail about the organization is found on the website. 
#### This project is ever changing as the organization changes. For future changes/plans, I plan to add a back end to this website for a user based system, easy firsthand contact with the organization, and more.
