          <h2>About NaloxAware</h2>
            <p2>Here at NaloxAware, our goal is to educate underprivileged communities on the importance of Naloxone. 
              It is not only important for Narcan to be available for those at risk of overdosing but also for bystanders. 
              Naloxone is a highly effective anti-opioid agent and is not too troublesome for most to attain. 
              It is carried by many pharmacies, but not all. NaloxAware hopes to make Narcan more accessible by supplying people with it directly. 
              Factors which disrepute the strength of naloxone include a lack of awareness. Many communities lack access or information on THN kits 
              making it difficult for better safety precautions for prescription medications to be installed. 
              NaloxAware hopes to bring the power of naloxone into focus, as naloxone symbolizes second chances at life.</p2>

          <h2>What is Naloxone?</h2>
          <p2>Note that it is important to first understand how opioids work to understand Naloxone.
             Reversing an overdose within 2-5 minutes through Naloxone can work in 3 different forms, but all forms work towards the same overall goal.
             Naloxone can be given through nasal spray, injection under the skin, or injection into the veins.
              In the same way that substances reach the brain faster when injected, Naloxone works quickest when injected directly into the veins. 
              What Naloxone does do is replace and block the opioids on the nerve cells, prompting the reversal of respiratory depression as well as sedation. 
             Please acknowledge that naloxone has no effect on non-opioid substances, such as;
              benzodiazepines, psychostimulants, barbiturates, alcohol, sedatives or marijuana.
               Naloxone given to someone who does not require it will have no additional effect on them, so do not be hesitant to use it. 
               Furthermore, Naloxone may only be active for between 20-90 minutes while the lifespan of an opioid may last longer. 
               This means that it is still very much necessary to dial 911 and it may be necessary to dose a person repeatedly.
                Training for naloxone is available from pharmacists, when purchased or attained. For more on using naloxone, check
                 (insert link to different section on using it) on our page.</p2>

          <h2>On Opioids</h2>
          <p2>To understand Naloxone, the opioids it targets must be considered first. These opioids include; fentanyl, morphine, codeine, 
            and heroin. Because these opioids are strong prescription medications, generally used for the purpose of pain relief, they are 
            highly addictive. There are many different ways in which an opioid can be misused, such as; Consuming the medicine in a way which 
            it is not intended to be (ex; taking more than the prescribed amount, insufflation, etc.), taking medicine which is not prescribed 
            to you, taking medicine for the purpose of getting high. Misusing a drug often ends in overdose. Similarly to a jigsaw puzzle, 
            opioids attach to and trigger nerve cells in the brain which are classified as opioid receptors. These receptors are responsible 
            for opioids pleasurable effects and pain reliever abilities. They work under the limbic system- targeting a person’s emotions, the 
            brainstem- in charge of a human’s natural and automatic responses such as breathing, and the spinal cord- which receives sensory 
            information before the brain reads it. When taken in generous amounts, these narcotics work stronger than necessary, causing a 
            person’s breathing to slow, oxygen levels to deplete, and they may become unresponsive to physical stimulation. Preceding the low 
            oxygen in the bloodstream, organs begin to fail, resulting in death. Narcan works to combat all of these symptoms.</p2>
